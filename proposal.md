## A Phylomemetic Approach to the Materiality of Organizing

In studies of online and virtual communities, scholars are continually calling for research agenda that focuses more explicitly on the material aspects of collaboration (e.g. Orlikowski and Scott, 2007; Pollock, 2012 Rosner and Ames, 2013).Yet, few of these studies also acknowledge that digital materials (e.g. software) seem to lack matter (Barley and Leonardi, 2008). 

So, how does one study the materiality of the immaterial? 

Thus far, the study of materiality has been a rhetorical move that shifts attention away from physical aspects of an artifact and towards concepts such as "practical instantiation" and "significance" of software (Leonardi, 2011). That is to say that material aspects of organizing have been studied in exactly the same ways as discourse, routine, and practices: through narrative description. 

This talk offers an introduction to the study of the material aspects of organizing through a technique called *phylomemetics*. Similar to (and named after) phylogenetic methods used in evolutionary biology, phylomemetic approaches can be used to create  geneologies of cultural objects - including digital artifacts. 

Phylomemetic methods have been preivously used to study the history of physical objects like cornets (TÃ«mkin & Eldredge, 2007), languages (cite soemthing) and even folk tales (Tehrani, 2013). Our work here focuses on a virtual organization - Debian, a distribution of the Linux open-source operation system. We use phylomemetics to identify moments of cultural evolution - for instance, when Debian substantively changed from one generation to the next. 

We ask what we can discern sociologically, organizationally, and culturally through this method, and from these visualizations? 

Our insights can be compared to, and as we suggest, combined with ethnographic methods of inquiry. For instance, we can combine our quantification of "speciation events" through phylomemetics with "ethical moments" documented in a deep ethnography of the Debian community (Coleman, 2005). In combination these two methods - ethnography and phylomemetics - offer digital humanists and social scientists a new mode of intellectual engagement with culture from both a material and hermeneutic perspective. 

We further argue that the visulaizations produced through these methods are a new text to be read by science and technology studies - one that can be used to thicken the descriptive tendencies of those studying collaboration, and simultaneously clarify and identify meaningful points of "speciation" (points at which collaborative cultures diverge).
